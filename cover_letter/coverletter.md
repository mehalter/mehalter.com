I am writing to you regarding your Software Engineer/Researcher position.
I recently graduated from Georgia Tech with my Bachelor of Science degree in computer science, and have been conducting research with the Georgia Tech Research Institute for over 3 years now.
My studies at Georgia Tech allowed me to build a solid foundation of technical abilities, while my research experience helped develop the skills to discover novel solutions to open-ended research problems, communicate my findings, and balance work on several projects simultaneously.

Your posting mentions a need for functional programming and formal verification skills, which happens to be the focus of a lot that I do research on.
One of my current research projects, that I am a lead contributor on, is a category theory approach to defining metamodeling tasks for representing and composing scientific models.
This project allows me to provide value in many ways, ranging from writing formal proofs to verify the validity of our solutions, to developing software to apply these theoretical proofs to solve real problems.

I have experience in both full-stack development in a variety of languages, and the the many facets of more traditional research such as solving open-ended questions, communicating findings in research papers, and verbally presenting new ideas.
I would be thrilled to apply my skill set and continue learning alongside your cross-functional team of software engineers and researchers.

My enclosed resume expands on my coursework, employment, skills, and recent projects.
I'm looking forward to discussing the position and my qualifications with you in more detail soon.
I can be reached at (704) 490-9840, or micah@mehalter.com anytime.
I am also collaborating on a project with Galois, and will be available in Portland, OR from August 28\--30, 2019.
