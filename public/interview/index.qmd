## Background

**Education**

- B.S. in Computer Science (2019, Georgia Tech)
- M.S. in Computer Science, Machine Learning (2022, Georgia Tech)

**Past Experience**

- Open Source Engagement ([AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim): >6.6k ðŸŒŸ)
- Machine Learning
- High Performance Computing
- Applied Category Theory

::: {.notes}
- Just to give a bit of background on myself
- I did my undergraduate degree at Georgia Tech in computer science, for those of you familiar with the thread system in GT's computer science department, I had a focus in system architecture and theory.
- Last year I finished up getting a masters from Georgia Tech as well with a specialization in machine learning
  - I spend a lot of my free time engaging with open source software. This ranges from contributions to projects as well as maintaining my own large scale open source project and helping build an open source community of users
  - I have had experience in machine learning and AI both in school as well as a couple research projects when I previously worked for GTRI. Most of this was done in the Python programming language using packages such as scikit-learn, tensorflow, and pytorch and utilizing many standard data manipulation libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib
  - I have dont some work in personal and professional capacities surrounding high performance computing and server management. Previously with GTRI my biggest contribution to this space was helping harden an HPC cluster with the DISA STIG guides to fit contractual requirements, but I also manage a small distributed cluster at home for personal use that runs Kubernetes and RHEL9.
  - Lastly a lot of my past research has been in regards to applying category theory ideas to scientific computing in an effort to improve modeling workflows for scientists
- Today I am going to take a deeper look at the applied category theory side of things, discuss where this line of research has gone to, demonstrate some of these category theory ideas can be applied to scientific modeling, and touch on where this research could continue going.

## Compositional scientific modeling

- Applied category theory promises to reduce complexity and boost engineering
  efficiency through _compositionality_
- Contemporary scientific models can be extremely large and complex, but they
  are usually built out of simpler pieces
- **Our goal**: Build ACT software that makes it easier to compose scientific
  models

## C-sets

**Definition**: Given a small category $\mathcal{C}$, a _$\mathcal{C}$-set_ is a functor $\mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Set}$. <br/>
A $\mathcal{C}$-set is also called a "copresheaf on $\mathcal{C}$."

**Example**: The _schema for graphs_ is the category $\mathcal{C}$ generated by

<!-- https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMixbMCwwLCJFIl0sWzEsMCwiViJdLFswLDEsInRndCIsMix7Im9mZnNldCI6MX1dLFswLDEsInNyYyIsMCx7Im9mZnNldCI6LTF9XV0= -->

A $\mathcal{C}$-set is then a _graph_, aka a "directed multigraph."

::: {.notes}
- Just a bit of background, a category here is defined as a set of objects and morphisms, where morphisms are mappings that define relationships between the objects within the category.
- C-sets is a functor that maps a category C to a finit set.
- Here we can see a categorical definition of a graph where we have two objects, E which would be edges and V which would be vertices, as well as two morphisms that define the relationship of the source and target verticies for a given edge.
- For this category, the C-set would be when we select a list of edges and vertices and define the mappings for the sources and targets of each edge which would give us a complete directed multigraph
:::

## C-sets in Catlab

```{julia}
#| echo: true
using Catlab, Catlab.CategoricalAlgebra

@present SchemaGraphs(FreeSchema) begin
  V::Ob
  E::Ob
  src::Hom(E,V)
  tgt::Hom(E,V)
end
@acset_type Graph(SchemaGraphs, index=[:src, :tgt])

g = Graph()
add_parts!(g, :V, 3)
add_parts!(g, :E, 2, src=[1,2], tgt=[2,3])
g
```

::: {.notes}
- Catlab is a general purpose category theory library for the Julia programming language that aims to make it easy to define categorical structures and then perform operations on them
- Here  we can see the definition of the Graph schema with the two objects V and E as well as the two morphisms src and tgt that map Edges to Vertices
- Once we define the schema and designate it C-set we can then start adding sets of things to it to populate the object
- Here we are adding 3 verticies and then adding 2 edges
- This is a very barebones API for interacting with these categorical structures, but we will see later on how this actually makes it easy for a domain scientist to easily generate someing closer to a domain specific language for their own system.

::: {.notes}
- This is great, but when we want to apply this to an actual scientific problem, a lot of the time it's useful to be able to keep track of attributes on these objects.
- This gives us the idea of an "Attributed C-Set" where we can add mappings to arbitrary types in the category such as adding a weight to the edges in our graph.

## Structured Cospans

Structured cospans model *open systems* ([Baez & Courser
2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04630)).

**Definition:** Given a functor $L: \mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{X}$, a *structured cospan* is a cospan in $\mathcal{X}$ of form:

<!-- https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMyxbMSwwLCJ4Il0sWzAsMSwiTChhKSJdLFsyLDEsIkwoYikiXSxbMiwwLCJvIiwyXSxbMSwwLCJpIl1d -->
<iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMyxbMSwwLCJ4Il0sWzAsMSwiTChhKSJdLFsyLDEsIkwoYikiXSxbMiwwLCJvIiwyXSxbMSwwLCJpIl1d&embed" width="432" height="304" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe>

where $a, b \in \mathcal{A}$ and $x \in \mathcal{X}$

::: {.notes}
- The powerful thing that we gain from using this categorical structure is we can then define composition to these structures. Our first attempt at this came from a paper by John Baez which formalizes the idea of structured cospans which provides a nice categorical framework for defining open systems
- We can define this open system as the following cospan where L is a functor from cateogry A to category X
- Here A is the category of finite sets and little a and little b would be us picking specifc sets that map to objects in a model within category X
- In our graph example this could be a list of verticies in our graph that we want to consider "input" vertices and "output vertices"
- With this definition we can investigate a couple different ways to think about composition of open systems
:::

## Composition Horizontally

Horizontal composition can be thought of as two systems happening sequentially: $x \cdot y$

<!-- https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNixbMSwxLCJ4Il0sWzAsMiwiTChhKSJdLFsyLDIsIkwoYikiXSxbNCwyLCJMKGMpIl0sWzMsMSwieSJdLFsyLDAsIngrX3tMKGIpfXkiXSxbMiwwLCJvXzEiLDJdLFsxLDAsImlfMSJdLFsyLDQsImlfMiJdLFszLDQsIm9fMiIsMl0sWzQsNSwial95IiwyXSxbMCw1LCJqX3giXV0= -->

::: {.notes}
- The first way we can think about composition is piecing two open systems together horizontally
- This would be matching up the ouptuts of one system with the inputs of another system.
- Here we can see we have an open system on x and an open system on y where the output of x is equal to the input of y
- Then we need to solve for the pushout of this diagram to compute this apex at the top x + y in relation to L(b)
- This pushout operation is something that will be dependent on the category you are working in and needs to be deined by the developer.
- In our graph case this would look like relabelling the verticies in y so that the shared verticies defined by L(b) are the same and then updating the labelling of the non-shared vertices so that they are unique and then updating the mappings of each edge so that they respect the new values of the edges
:::

## Composition Vertically

Vertical Composition can be thought of as two systems happening in parallel: $x \otimes x^\prime$

<!-- https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMyxbMSwwLCJ4K3heXFxwcmltZSJdLFswLDEsIkwoYSthXlxccHJpbWUpIl0sWzIsMSwiTChiK2JeXFxwcmltZSkiXSxbMiwwLCJvK29eXFxwcmltZSIsMl0sWzEsMCwiaStpXlxccHJpbWUiXV0= -->

::: {.notes}
- Our other way to think of compositon is vertically which can be thought of as two open systems happening at the same time, or in parallel.
- This is another operation that will need to be defined by the person implementing the category so that it makes sense in the situation you are working in
- In category theory this is referred to as the "coproduct" which is basically the notion of a disjoint union
- Back to our graph example, this would basically be taking the disjoint union of the vertices and transitions. We can think about this as relabelling the verticies in x prime so that they do not conflict with the vertices in x and then updating the transitions with these new labels. We also need to update the legs of our cospan as well by applying this relabelling of the inputs and outputs and then doing the union.

::: {.notes}
- We have added a generalized implementation of these open system ideas into Catlab as well where you can take a schema definition of a category and easily convert it to an open system along one of the objects in the category
- Here for our graph example we can create an open graph on the vertices objects in the category and then define an open graph with the inputs and outputs defines as finite sets
- Here we have a single input of the graph as vertice 1 and we have two output vertices which are vertices 3 and 4

- Once your category is defined and you define what it means to pushout and take the colimit of in the category, you can then start doing composition.
-  Here we can define a 2nd graph, this one has 2 inputs and one output vertice
- This is great, but now how can we apply this to a more practical type of system that can help us do some scientific modeling

::: {.notes}
- Petri nets are a graph based model of concurrent systems, they are made up of a few types of objects, mainly states and transitions
- Transitions have inputs and outputs and move items from one state to another
- For example, petri nets are used a lot in epidemiology modeling, states could be something along the lines of susceptible, infected, and recovered
- And transitions could be something like infection where you can an input arcs from the susceptible state and the infected state, and then two output arcs going to the infected state
:::

## Epidemiology primitive reactions

::: {.notes}
- We can now use the Catlab generated types to build some basic petri nets
- explain examples...
- Now that we have a way to build these basic petri nets, how can we use this along with our definition of composition to easily build full models?

## Theory of Epidemiology

#| echo: true
@present Epi(FreeHypergraphCategory) begin
  (S,E,I,R,D)::Ob
  infection::Hom(SâŠ—I, I)
  exposure::Hom(SâŠ—I, E)
  illness::Hom(E,I)
  recovery::Hom(I,R)
  death::Hom(I,D)
end

sir = Epi[:infection] â‹… Epi[:recovery]
```

```{julia}
#| echo: true
sir |> display_wd
```

::: {.notes}
- We can define our theory of how epidemiology works as a presentation on a category and use this to build categorical definitions of models
- For example we can define a simple theory of how epidemiology works in the world. Explain presentation...
- And then we can se it to build up our models compositionally
- We can also view our composition formula using wiring diagrams to easily see what sort of relationships are being created.
- Here we are composing infection and recovery to say that both of these interactions are happening in our system and create the relationship that the population that is getting infected in the infection transition is the same infected population that is then recovering
- Once this composition formula is defined, we can provide it some open petri nets that fit the domain and codomain of our morphisms in this presentation and generate the final petri net
- It turns out this was a great start at building models and seems great, but very quickly started breaking down...
:::


## Where this breaks down...

```{julia}
#| echo: true
seir = @program Epi (s::S, i::I) begin
  e = exposure(s, i)
  i2 = illness(e)
  r = recovery([i, i2])
  return r
end
seir |> display_wd
```

::: {.notes}
- First, defining these compositions in terms of vertical and horizontal compositions is not very intuitive for the scientists, so we developed this new syntax that is similar to writing a program
- Having moprhisms with inputs and outputs can actually be written very nicely as code in a programming language. Where the morphisms are functions that take in parameters (the inputs) and produce outputs which can be stored as "variables" that can be passed into other morphisms
- But with this directed approach there becomes this issue of managing your inputs and outputs so that they always match.
- A very simple example that already shows how complicated this gets is with a simple SEIR model. This is very similar to our SIR model that we previously defined but has an intermediary step between susceptible and ill where someone has been exposed and there is an incubation period.
- We want to compose this model but we have to create the relationship between the infected population in the illness transition with the infected population going into the exposure.
- This means the scientist has to remember to define these equivalencies  and the diagram starts looking really funky
- Also when you look at a directed diagram like this, it seems to be communicating this idea of directionality where exposure happens first, then illness, then recovery
- While this is true for a single person, this is a model of the entire population and all of these interactions are actually happening simultaneously.
- This is a good example of how the semantics communicated by the categorical representation weren't aligning with the domain specific knowledge that the scientist has indicating that the formalization may be wrong
- This isn't a direct cause/effect between these populations, but rather relationships between them that happen concurrently.

## Structured Multicospans

**Definition:** Given a functor $L: \mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{X}$, a *structured multicospan* is a cospan in $\mathcal{X}$ of form:

where $a_1,\dots,a_n \in \mathcal{A}$ and $x \in \mathcal{X}$

::: {.notes}
- So what if we wanted to instead compose along any of our objects at a given point rather than making sure all of the "inputs" and "outputs" line up
- What if instead of a cospan with two legs, we had a leg exposed for each of the objects in our model and could compose along any one of them. It turns out this works out very nicely and is a type of algebriac structure called an operad.

## Undirected Composition

::: {.notes}
- Now that we are composing things in any direction we have this idea of undirected composition
- this type of wiring diagram looks a little different
- Our previous syntactic sugar for defining "programs" in Catlab also doesn't make sense since there are no "inputs" or "outputs", just relationships, so we can generate a different type of syntax for this that we call "relation"
- Here we can simply define the populations in our system and then define the interactions that are happening between these systems and we can use our same theory of epidemiology for defining these compositions.
- This does a much better job at representing the semantics of our system where these interactions are all happening at the same time on the populations.
- Here we can also see the petry net that gets generated we well.
- We can start to see here how Catlab provides not only a generic bare-bones way of defining categories and working within them, but also provides a framework for easily generating domain specific languages.
- I have simply defined how we believe epidemiology should work and it is able to generate this relationship syntax for defining models within this theory.

- here is our original SIR model using this new relationship syntax
- We have 3 populations: susceptible, infected, and recovered populations
- And there are two interactions happening
  - one where an infected and susceptible person get together and result in two infected people
  - and one where an infected person spontaneously recovers
- Once a model has been defined we can also think of these new models as new open systems to compose
- This can be thought of us drawing a circle around this undirected wiring diagram and exposing these wires that are going outwards

- Now we can use our coexist model and our model of cross exposure to build a much more complex model where there are two populations each going through the covid infection with some cross exposure between them
- Notice here that we have simplified these operades to a single wire, in our idea of multi-cospans, we can freely bundle and split up wires to simplify the view of the model.

## Multi-Generational COEXIST model

::: {.notes}
- Here is the resulting petri net for modeling two populations with cross exposure.
- We can see how complicated these models can get very easily
- With this compositional and hirearchical structure, scientists are able to focus on the semantics of what their model is describing rather than the code that implements the model.

## Simulate the system

```{julia}
using OrdinaryDiffEq
using Plots
```

```{julia}
#| echo: true
tspan = (0.0, 100.0)
prob = ODEProblem(vectorfield(twoNCoexist_petri),
                  concentrations(twoNCoexist_petri),
                  tspan, rates(twoNCoexist_petri))
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5())
plot(sol, xlabel="Time", ylabel="Number of people", legend=:topright)
```

::: {.notes}
- Once we have generated a petri net we can provide some initial conditions and transition rates to our system and pass it to a solver to generate the results of the simulation
:::

## Next Steps

- Better stratification API based on reflexive relationships ($\forall(x: A), x \sim x$)
- Model space exploration based on the space of possible "hypotheses" defined by the theory
- Machine learning process to fit the parameters to incomplete data

::: {.notes}
- This research process has uncovered many things when it comes to understanding composition of scientific models as well as the idea of representing scientific theories as categorical structures, but there are many places to go with this line of research.
- Currently the stratficiation is done pretty manually, but I think there is a better way to do this through reflexive relations where each element of a set is related to itself
- By defining a scientific theory as a categorical structure we are also defining the space of all possible scientific hypotheses, it would be very interesting to investigate the possibility of exploring this space to potentially assist scientists in exploring possible hypotheses
- Lastly, simulations shown at the end of this presentation were generated using provided parameters from the scientist. It would be great in the future to investigate a way to apply machine learning methods to fit the parameters to the data to validate or invalidate hypotheses would be an interesting next step. It would be tricky because you will need to be able to fit the model using incomplete data. In the epidemiology example you don't always have data on each population but may have data on just the number of infected people who have tested positive for an illness
