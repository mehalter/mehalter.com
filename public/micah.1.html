<h1 id="notes">NOTES</h1>
<p>Outside of the field of computer science I have many hobbies and passions including Ultimate Frisbee, coffee, and music.</p>
<p>At Georgia Tech and the greater Atlanta area, I am a very active member of the Ultimate Frisbee community. This includes playing on multiple competitive teams throughout the years and competing in tournaments nationally and globally.</p>
<p>I have been an avid coffee enthusiast for several years, frequenting many coffee shops, getting to know local coffee roasters and baristas, and hand brewing my own craft coffee.</p>
<p>Growing up I was very involved with band and played many instruments including piano and flute. Nowadays I don’t play very often, but love to attend concerts and live music events.</p>
