While working at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, I have found that
I love being involved with research projects.
I enjoy taking charge of open ended questions and exploring new methods
and ways of tackling tough problems.
.SH NOTES
.PP
Outside of the field of computer science I have many hobbies and
passions including Ultimate Frisbee, coffee, and music.
.PP
At Georgia Tech and the greater Atlanta area, I am a very active member
of the Ultimate Frisbee community.
This includes playing on multiple competitive teams throughout the years
and competing in tournaments nationally and globally.

I have been an avid coffee enthusiast for several years, frequenting
many coffee shops, getting to know local coffee roasters and baristas,
and hand brewing my own craft coffee.
