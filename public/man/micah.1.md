# NOTES

Outside of the field of computer science I have many hobbies and passions
including Ultimate Frisbee, coffee, and music.

At Georgia Tech and the greater Atlanta area, I am a very active member of the
Ultimate Frisbee community. This includes playing on multiple competitive teams
throughout the years and competing in tournaments nationally and globally.

I have been an avid coffee enthusiast for several years, frequenting many coffee
shops, getting to know local coffee roasters and baristas, and hand brewing my
own craft coffee.

Growing up I was very involved with band and played many instruments including
piano and flute. Nowadays I don't play very often, but love to attend concerts
and live music events.
