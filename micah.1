.SH NOTES
.PP
Outside of the field of computer science I have many hobbies and
passions including Ultimate Frisbee, coffee, and music.
.PP
At Georgia Tech and the greater Atlanta area, I am a very active member
of the Ultimate Frisbee community. This includes playing on multiple
competitive teams throughout the years and competing in tournaments
nationally and globally.
.PP
I have been an avid coffee enthusiast for several years, frequenting
many coffee shops, getting to know local coffee roasters and baristas,
and hand brewing my own craft coffee.
.PP
Growing up I was very involved with band and played many instruments
including piano and flute. Nowadays I don\[cq]t play very often, but
love to attend concerts and live music events.
